To add Syntax Highlighting to your files in GitHub, make sure the files have the correct file extension for the syntax highlighting your are looking for.

For example:
Name files ".php" at the end, to get Syntax Highlighting for PHP code.
Name files ".tpl" at the end and as file extension to activate syntax highlighting of Smarty Templating Language
".html" for HTML
".css" for CSS
etc.
